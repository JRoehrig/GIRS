Welcome to GIRS!
================

``girs`` (Geographic Information and Remote Sensing) is basically a wrapper around osgeo/gdal and osgeo/ogr written in python with additional  geoprocessing algorithms. It was initially developed as part of a toolset to support geoprocessing for water resources management, then later splitted into a standalone general programm for geoprocessing.
